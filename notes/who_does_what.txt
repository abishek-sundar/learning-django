I will call the folder made by startproject as project and the folder made by startapp as app.
Note: it is hard to know when to have quotes and when not to. Be careful about what you are importing and if you need quotes or not.
I would suggest to just turn your brain off and copy/paste.


1 ) project/urls.py will be used to access your app first. Add every app to this url list.

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('app.urls')),
]

2 ) inside app/urls.py, do this. You might be able to avoid the import and chuck app/views/home.html within quotes, but there's no upside to that at all.
home is 'home.html' inside /app/views/


from django.urls import path
from app import views
urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.home),
]

3) Inside views.py, 

from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
def home(request):
    return render(request,'app/home.html')

4) Add your app in INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py inside project/

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'app',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]

5) Run your server and hope for the best.
